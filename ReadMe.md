# CS 61A Note

## Chapter 1
***Tips:***
> Sometimes, it will take you a long time to solve one problem. Don't be upset, it's normal and worthy. The ability of solving problem by yourself is a core skill you have to gain in the process of learning coding.
> Learning slowly is the best and fast way to learn. You will learn fast after you have obtained necessary knowledge and skill in the former slow learning process.


## Chapter 2
### 2.2 Data Abstraction
In general, we can express abstract data using a collection of selectors and constructors, together with some behavior conditions. As long as the behavior conditions are met (such as the division property above), the selectors and constructors constitute a valid representation of a kind of data. The implementation details below an abstraction barrier may change, but if the behavior does not, then the data abstraction remains valid, and any program written using this data abstraction will remain correct.

***Tips:***
> Debugging is twice as hard as coding. A complex and long code is more easily to debug than an elegant and brief one. Therefore, you should write a version of understandable code first, then try to enable it more elegant.

## Chapter 3
### 3.2 Functional Programming
The machine-language programmer is concerned with using the given hardware to erect systems and utilities for the efficient implementation of resource-limited computations. 
High-level languages, erected on a machine-language substrate, hide concerns about the representation of data as collections of bits and the representation of programs as sequences of primitive instructions.

When you draw something, it may not work, therefore, using the Scheme interpreter in hw06 is a better choice.
